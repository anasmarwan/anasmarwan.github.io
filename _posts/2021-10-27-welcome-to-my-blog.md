## Hello, World!

Hi, everyone! My name is Anas. I'm Malaysian and I love Malaysian foods (miss them so much :persevere:). OK, that's not the whole point. I'm a Maths student at King's College and I love what I've been studying until today (still look forward to studying more Maths though). How about you guys?

## So what's this about?

Since I love Maths and I'm studying Maths, I want to share the Maths I've been doing with you guys. Excited?    

## Blog posts or Maths articles :grey_question:

Hmmm... Very good question. I have no intention to make the blog entries to be really formal, like a publishable standard one. Hence, they cannot be math articles. I wish to share my personal views on some mathematical concepts, in a much simpler or easier to understand by most people. I believe that most non-mathematicians have been wondering what mathematicians do. This is a legit question tho. Perhaps, through this blog, the readers will have some idea of the Mathematics beyond school maths.  


See you in my next post! :wave:
