## Notes
---

### Undergraduate (KCL)

These are few notes I wrote during my years as undergraduate at King's

2021/2022
---

    - [**6CCM341A Fundamental of Probabilty Theory**] In the making. 
    - Probably more is due at the end of winter break.

2020/2021
---

    - [**5CCM226A Metric Spaces and Topology**][mst] (Handwritten) poor readability I guess. But when writing this note, I tried to highlight the discussions which are relevant to either metric spaces or topological spaces. The content covers the notion of convergence, continuity, compactness, connectedness(top) in both metric spaces and topological spaces. A brief discussion on product and quotient topology is included.
    - I have few others incomplete LaTeX notes (Real Analyis and Intro to Number theory). When time permits or maybe when there is a reason to do intensive revision on those subjects, I will revisit and complete the notes.

2019/2020

    - [**4CCM113A Linear Algebra and Geometry I**][lag1] (Handwritten)
    - [**4CCM121A Introduction to Algebra**] In process of cleaning/formatting the notes.
