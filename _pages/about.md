I am a 3rd year BSc Mathematics with Statistics students at [King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk). I am currently doing a final year project on The Riemann-Roch theorem on surfaces, under the guidance of [Prof. Simon Scott](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/simon-scott).

I am an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant (UGTA) at Department of Mathematics, KCL. My tasks include assisting first-year Maths undergraduates with their assigments, which cover a range of modules - Calculus I, Linear Algebra & Geomtery I, Sequences & Series, and Introduction to Algebra. On top of that, I also volunteer to be a SPM Mathematics Tutor with Rakan Tutor, to support underserved secondary school students in Malaysia.

My academic interest(s) lies in the field of Geometry and Topology. My music interests were dominated by K-Pop industries. You can reach by [email](mailto:aabrazak1@gmail.com) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/anasmarwan/) if you wish to talk more about my interests.
