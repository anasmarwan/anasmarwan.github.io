I am a third-year BSc Mathematics with Statistics student at [King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk). I am currently doing a final year project on the Riemann-Roch theorem for surfaces, under the guidance of [Prof. Simon Scott](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/simon-scott).

My academic interests lie in the field of Geometry and Topology. My music interests are dominated by K-Pop industries. You can reach out to me me [email](mailto:anas.ab_razak@kcl.ac.uk) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/anasmarwan/) if you wish to talk more about my interests.
